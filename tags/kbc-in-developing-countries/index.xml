In KBC, knowledge itself forms the basis of value, and each component contributes to a sum where all knowledge adds up to one unified currency (sumKBC = 1).

By aligning incentives around truth, KBC encourages participants to share and validate information. The K-Chain ledger, supported by LightWeb and Oracle AI, ensures transparency and fairness.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
