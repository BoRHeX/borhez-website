&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s interconnected world, where reliable and secure communication is essential, mesh networks have emerged as a powerful solution. Mesh networks are decentralized networks where each node can communicate directly with any other node, creating a web-like structure that is resilient and adaptable. This technology is particularly important for KBC, as it aligns with the decentralized nature of the platform and the need for efficient information sharing through LightWeb.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
