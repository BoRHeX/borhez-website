&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s information age, the validation of knowledge is more crucial than ever. With the rise of fake news, misinformation, and deep fakes, it has become increasingly difficult to discern what is true and what is not. This is where the concept of Large Language Models (LLMs) comes into play and its impact on knowledge validation cannot be understated. In the context of Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC), understanding how LLMs can be utilized to verify and authenticate knowledge is key to building a trustworthy and transparent knowledge economy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Impact Investing in KBC — Daily KBC Note (2026-01-23)</title><link>https://borhez.com/posts/2026-01-23-impact-investing-in-kbc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 18:34:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://borhez.com/posts/2026-01-23-impact-investing-in-kbc/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="impact-investing-in-kbc-shaping-a-fairer-knowledge-driven-world"&gt;Impact Investing in KBC: Shaping a Fairer, Knowledge-Driven World&lt;/h1&gt;
