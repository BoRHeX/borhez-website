The **K‑Chain** is a decentralized, append‑only ledger inspired by blockchain technology. Instead of recording financial transactions, it stores **knowledge blocks**—verified units of information such as facts, data sets or algorithms. Each block contains:

- **Content:** the statement or dataset itself.
- **Metadata:** information about the contributor, timestamp and related tags.
- **Links:** references to other blocks, creating a network of related knowledge.

Blocks are validated through a **Proof of Knowledge** process. Oracle AIs check that submissions are accurate, not duplicated and contribute value before adding them to the chain. Once accepted, blocks become immutable and publicly accessible, forming an ever‑expanding map of human and artificial intelligence.

By tying KBC issuance to the creation of verified knowledge, the K‑Chain aligns economic value with truth and encourages continuous discovery.
