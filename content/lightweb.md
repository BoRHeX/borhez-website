title: "LightWeb"
description: "A decentralized truth‑indexed internet layer built on KBC"
---

LightWeb is the decentralized "knowledge network" layer of KBC.  It sits on top of the **KnowledgeChain** ledger and provides a censorship‑resistant, truth‑indexed web of content.  Instead of websites hosted on a central server, LightWeb distributes knowledge blocks across the network and indexes them by their semantic relationships.

Because every content unit is backed by verifiable knowledge, LightWeb can deliver search and browsing experiences where accuracy and trust are built in.  The network encourages transparency, collaboration and open access.  As the ecosystem evolves, LightWeb will become the foundation for decentralized applications that leverage KBC, Oracle AI and the K‑Chain.
