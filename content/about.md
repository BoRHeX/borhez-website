description: "Meet the vision behind KBC"
---

**Master BoRHeZ** is the visionary behind Knowledge‑Based Currency. An engineer, therapist and perpetual traveler, he believes that our monetary systems should reflect and reward the creation of knowledge. KBC began as an idea to align economics with truth and has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem built on the K‑Chain ledger and supported by Oracle AIs.

## Mission
Our mission is to create a stable, transparent currency backed by verified knowledge. By encouraging contributions from anyone—individuals or AI—the KBC ecosystem promotes continuous learning and collective intelligence. Every piece of validated knowledge increases the value of the system.

## Values
- **Truth as value:** KBC units are created from verifiable knowledge.
- **Transparency:** Each knowledge block is publicly auditable and permanently recorded.
- **Inclusivity:** Everyone can earn KBC by contributing validated information.

## History
What started as a set of notes and experiments has grown into a multi‑disciplinary project with an open‑source Minimum Viable System (MVS) built with FastAPI and Streamlit. The vision continues to evolve toward a decentralized LightWeb where knowledge, currency and collaboration converge.
