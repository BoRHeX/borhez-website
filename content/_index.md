### A new way to value knowledge

Knowledge‑Based Currency (KBC) reimagines value: instead of being backed by gold or fiat promises, each unit of KBC represents verified knowledge【599027023887502†L175-L181】. By rewarding truthful contributions with currency, KBC turns curiosity, learning and discovery into an economic engine.

Our ecosystem includes:

- **K‑Chain** — a decentralized ledger that records and links verified knowledge blocks【599027023887502†L175-L181】.
- **Oracle AI** — advanced intelligences that validate contributions and synthesize new insights.
- **LightWeb** — a platform where humans and machines collaborate, access verified knowledge and create value.

Join us as we build a future where **truth is currency** and **knowledge is freedom**.
