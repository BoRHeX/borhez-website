### Knowledge‑Based Currency

KBC is a currency backed by **verified knowledge**.  Each coin represents a piece of information that has been validated and recorded on the KnowledgeChain ledger.  This aligns economic value with truth and creates incentives for discovery and learning.

Our ecosystem includes the **K‑Chain** for storing knowledge blocks, **Oracle AI** for validation and synthesis, and **LightWeb** to enable collaboration between humans and machines.

Explore our [About](/about/) page to learn about the project's origins, read about the [K‑Chain](/k-chain/), dive into [LightWeb](/lightweb/), learn about [Oracle AI](/oracle-ai/), review the [MVS](/mvs/) prototype, consult our [Resources](/resources/) for technical papers, or browse our [Blog](/posts/) for updates.
