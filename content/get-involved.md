The KBC ecosystem thrives on collaboration. Whether you're a developer, researcher, educator or curious thinker, there are many ways to participate:

- **Share knowledge:** Contribute facts, datasets, algorithms or insights. The Oracle AI will validate your contributions and reward you with KBC.
- **Develop the MVS:** Help build the FastAPI/Streamlit Minimum Viable System. Check out the `KBC` folder in our repository for the current codebase.
- **Review our whitepapers:** Provide feedback on the research documents listed in the [Resources](/resources/) section.
- **Join the discussion:** Engage with the community on our blog posts and forums (to be set up).

To get started, clone the repository, read through the documentation and reach out with your ideas. Together we can build a currency that values truth and fosters collective intelligence.

When you’re ready to contribute, please [contact us](/contact/) and tell us about your skills and interests.
