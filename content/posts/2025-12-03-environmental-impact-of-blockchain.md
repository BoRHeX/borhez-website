## Introduction

Blockchain technology has revolutionized the way we store and transfer data, but it also comes with its own set of environmental challenges. The energy consumption of traditional blockchain networks, like Bitcoin, has been a topic of concern due to their reliance on proof of work algorithms. This issue is crucial for KBC, as sustainability is one of its core values. Understanding the environmental impact of blockchain is essential for building a more eco-friendly and efficient knowledge economy.

## Overview

- **Key Principles**: The environmental impact of blockchain stems from the energy-intensive process of validating transactions and creating new blocks. Proof of work algorithms require miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles, consuming a significant amount of electricity.
- **KBC's Foundations**:
  - **K‑Chain**: By storing immutable knowledge claims on a distributed ledger, K‑Chain reduces the need for excessive energy consumption associated with traditional blockchains.
  - **LightWeb**: The decentralized network of LightWeb allows for efficient sharing of information without the need for energy-intensive mining operations.
  - **Oracle AI**: The intelligent engine of Oracle AI validates knowledge claims without the need for excessive computational power, minimizing environmental impact.
  - **Proof‑of‑Knowledge**: KBC's innovative consensus mechanism rewards contributors based on their expertise rather than energy consumption, promoting a sustainable and inclusive knowledge economy.
