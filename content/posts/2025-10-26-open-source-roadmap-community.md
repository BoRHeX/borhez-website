Open-Source Roadmap & Community serves as a pillar within the Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) ecosystem. In KBC, knowledge itself forms the basis of value, and each component contributes to a sum where all knowledge adds up to one unified currency (sumKBC = 1). The seemingly paradoxical formula [0=1]=2 invites us to reflect on the transformative power of combining opposing viewpoints to create new insights.

This post explores how open-source roadmap & community supports the verifiable knowledge framework. By aligning incentives around truth, KBC encourages participants to share and validate information. The K-Chain ledger, supported by LightWeb and Oracle AI, ensures transparency and fairness.

Through continuous learning and collaboration, the KBC community demonstrates that the sum of individual contributions can equal a greater whole.
