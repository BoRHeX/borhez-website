## Long-Term Storage of Knowledge: Preserving the Foundation of KBC

In the fast-paced digital age, the ability to store knowledge securely and access it when needed is crucial for the success of any platform. Long-term storage of knowledge ensures that valuable information remains intact, verifiable, and retrievable over time. For Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC), this topic is at the core of its mission to transform knowledge into a valuable digital asset.

## Overview
