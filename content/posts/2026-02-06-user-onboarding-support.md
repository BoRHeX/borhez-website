This is especially true for Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC), where the value of the currency is directly tied to the verifiable knowledge contributed by users. In this blog post, we will explore the importance of user onboarding and support in the KBC movement, how it relates to key principles of the platform, and how recent global events highlight the need for reliable and trustworthy knowledge sources.

## Overview

User onboarding and support in the KBC movement are essential for several reasons:

- **Ensuring Trust**: By providing users with a seamless onboarding process and ongoing support, KBC can build trust and credibility within its community.
