## Y-Engine (Truth-Relevance-Novelty-Impact): Unleashing the Power of Knowledge in KBC

Welcome, knowledge seekers, to a deep dive into the inner workings of the Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) project. Today, we're going to explore a key component that fuels the engine of truth, relevance, novelty, and impact within KBC: the Y-Engine.

### Overview

The Y-Engine, comprised of Truth, Relevance, Novelty, and Impact, serves as the guiding force behind the validation and dissemination of knowledge within KBC. Let's break down each component:

- **Truth**: The Y-Engine prioritizes verified and accurate knowledge, ensuring that only reliable information is stored and shared on the K-Chain ledger.
- **Relevance**: By focusing on relevance, the Y-Engine ensures that knowledge is timely and applicable to the current needs of users within the LightWeb network.
- **Novelty**: Encouraging innovation and new ideas, the Y-Engine rewards contributors who bring fresh perspectives and insights to the table, fostering a dynamic knowledge ecosystem.
- **Impact**: Lastly, the Y-Engine emphasizes the importance of knowledge that can make a difference, driving meaningful change and progress within the KBC community.

These principles align seamlessly with KBC's core technologies: K-Chain, LightWeb, Oracle AI, and Proof-of-Knowledge. K-Chain stores immutable knowledge claims, LightWeb facilitates efficient information sharing, Oracle AI validates and retrieves knowledge, and Proof-of-Knowledge rewards expertise. Together, they form the foundation upon which the Y-Engine operates, ensuring that knowledge within KBC is trustworthy, inclusive, and valuable.
