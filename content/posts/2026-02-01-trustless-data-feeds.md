# Trustless Data Feeds: Empowering the Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) Movement

In today's digital age, data has become the new currency. However, the challenge lies in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of this data. This is where trustless data feeds play a crucial role. Trustless data feeds provide a mechanism for obtaining verifiable information without having to rely on a central authority. This concept is central to the KBC movement, as it aims to create a decentralized knowledge economy where expertise is valued and rewarded.

## Overview

- **K-Chain**: The distributed ledger where immutable knowledge claims are stored securely.
- **LightWeb**: A decentralized network for efficient sharing of information.
- **Oracle AI**: The intelligent engine that validates and retrieves knowledge on demand.
- **Proof-of-Knowledge**: The mechanism that rewards contributors for their expertise.

In the context of KBC, trustless data feeds ensure that the knowledge claims stored on the K-Chain are accurate and reliable. By leveraging the power of Oracle AI and Proof-of-Knowledge, KBC can provide users with access to trustworthy information without the need for a central authority.
