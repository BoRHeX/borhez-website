# Blog Post: Archiving & Preservation in the Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) Movement

In today's fast-paced world where information is constantly being created and shared, the importance of archiving and preservation cannot be overstated. Archiving is the process of storing and maintaining historical records and documents, while preservation involves ensuring the longevity and accessibility of these materials for future generations. In the context of the Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) movement, archiving and preservation play a crucial role in creating a reliable and verifiable knowledge base that can be used to drive innovation and progress.

## Overview

- **Archiving**: Archiving in the KBC ecosystem involves storing immutable knowledge claims on the distributed ledger known as K-Chain. This ensures that valuable information is securely preserved and can be accessed by users when needed.
  
- **Preservation**: Preservation is achieved through the decentralized network called LightWeb, which enables efficient sharing of archived knowledge across the KBC platform. Oracle AI serves as the intelligent engine that validates and retrieves knowledge on demand, ensuring that the information remains accurate and up-to-date.

- **Proof-of-Knowledge**: In the KBC system, contributors are rewarded for their expertise through Proof-of-Knowledge, which replaces traditional proofs of work or stake. This incentivizes individuals to share their knowledge and contribute to the growth of the knowledge economy.
