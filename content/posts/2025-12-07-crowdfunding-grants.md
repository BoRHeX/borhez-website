## Crowdfunding & Grants: Empowering Knowledge Contributors

Crowdfunding and grants play a vital role in the Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) ecosystem by providing a means for individuals and organizations to support projects and initiatives that contribute valuable knowledge to the platform. In a traditional sense, crowdfunding involves raising small amounts of money from a large number of people to fund a project or venture. Grants, on the other hand, are non-repayable funds disbursed by organizations, governments, or foundations to support specific activities or initiatives.

In the context of KBC, crowdfunding and grants serve as mechanisms to incentivize knowledge contributors to share their expertise and contribute to the growth of the platform. By supporting projects through crowdfunding or providing grants to deserving individuals or organizations, the KBC community can foster a culture of collaboration and innovation, ultimately advancing the platform's mission of creating a decentralized knowledge economy.
