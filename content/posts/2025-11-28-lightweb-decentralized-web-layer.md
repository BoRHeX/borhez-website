## LightWeb (Decentralized Web Layer)

Welcome to the world of LightWeb, the decentralized web layer that plays a crucial role in the Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) project. Imagine LightWeb as the invisible threads that connect all the pieces of the KBC puzzle, allowing information to flow freely and securely across the network. In a digital landscape filled with centralized platforms and gatekeepers, LightWeb stands out as a beacon of decentralization, empowering users to share knowledge without intermediaries.

### Overview

- **Key Principles of LightWeb**:
  - **Decentralization**: LightWeb is built on the principles of decentralization, meaning that there is no single point of control or failure. This ensures that information remains accessible and resistant to censorship.
  - **Efficiency**: LightWeb is designed to facilitate the efficient sharing of information across the KBC network. By leveraging decentralized technologies, it streamlines the process of transmitting knowledge while maintaining security.
  - **Security**: LightWeb prioritizes the security and privacy of users' data. Through encryption and cryptographic techniques, it safeguards information from unauthorized access and tampering.

- **Relation to KBC's Foundations**:
  - **K-Chain**: The distributed ledger K-Chain relies on LightWeb to efficiently share knowledge claims across the network. This seamless integration ensures that verified knowledge is securely stored and accessible to all participants.
  - **Oracle AI**: The intelligent engine Oracle AI utilizes LightWeb to retrieve and validate knowledge on demand. By tapping into the decentralized web layer, Oracle AI can quickly verify the authenticity of information, enhancing the reliability of the KBC platform.
  - **Proof-of-Knowledge**: LightWeb plays a crucial role in the Proof-of-Knowledge consensus mechanism of KBC. Through decentralized communication channels, contributors can share their expertise and earn rewards based on the value of their knowledge contributions.
