## Introduction

Decentralized Peer Review is a crucial component of the Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) project, as it plays a vital role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the knowledge claims stored on the K-Chain ledger. By leveraging the power of a decentralized network of peers to validate and verify information, KBC is able to create a trustworthy ecosystem where expertise is rewarded and misinformation is minimized. In a world where misinformation runs rampant, decentralized peer review is a beacon of truth and integrity.

## Overview

- **Key Principles**: Decentralized Peer Review involves a network of individuals who review, critique, and authenticate knowledge claims submitted to the K-Chain ledger. These peers come from diverse backgrounds and possess varying levels of expertise, ensuring a well-rounded evaluation process.
- **Relevance to KBC's Foundations**:
  - **K-Chain**: The distributed ledger where knowledge claims are stored securely and immutably. Decentralized peer review ensures that only accurate and verified information is added to the ledger, maintaining the integrity of the system.
  - **LightWeb**: The decentralized network that facilitates efficient sharing of information. Peer reviewers can access and evaluate knowledge claims quickly and transparently, fostering a collaborative environment.
  - **Oracle AI**: The intelligent engine that validates and retrieves knowledge on demand. Peer reviewers work in conjunction with Oracle AI to ensure that knowledge claims meet the required standards of accuracy and reliability.
  - **Proof-of-Knowledge**: The mechanism through which contributors are rewarded for their expertise. Decentralized peer review plays a critical role in determining the value of knowledge claims and incentivizing contributors to participate in the ecosystem.
