KBC stands for **Knowledge‑Based Currency**, a novel form of money backed not by gold or government fiat but by verified knowledge. When you contribute a fact, a discovery or a solution to the KnowledgeChain, Oracle AIs validate it through a Proof of Knowledge process. If accepted, your contribution is recorded as a new block and you earn KBC tokens proportionate to its significance.

KBC operates within an ecosystem that includes:

- **K‑Chain**, a decentralized ledger of immutable knowledge blocks.
- **Oracle AI**, which verifies submissions and generates new insights from the chain.
- **LightWeb**, a decentralized platform where humans and machines collaborate on learning and innovation.

This system encourages continuous learning by turning curiosity and problem‑solving into tangible economic value. The more accurate knowledge we share, the richer the ecosystem becomes.
