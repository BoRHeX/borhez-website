# Unveiling the Y-Engine: Truth-Relevance-Novelty-Impact

In the realm of Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC), the Y-Engine plays a pivotal role in ensuring the quality and value of knowledge claims stored on the K-Chain. This innovative concept combines four essential elements - Truth, Relevance, Novelty, and Impact - to determine the veracity and significance of information. By understanding how the Y-Engine operates, we can appreciate its importance in shaping a trustworthy and dynamic knowledge economy.

## Overview

The Y-Engine operates as a sophisticated algorithm that evaluates knowledge claims based on four key principles:

- **Truth:** This component assesses the accuracy and reliability of information, ensuring that only verifiable facts are stored on the K-Chain.
- **Relevance:** The Y-Engine considers the context and significance of knowledge claims, filtering out irrelevant or outdated information to maintain a high standard of quality.
- **Novelty:** By prioritizing new and innovative ideas, the Y-Engine promotes the discovery of groundbreaking insights and fosters a culture of intellectual exploration.
- **Impact:** Finally, this element measures the influence and value of knowledge claims, highlighting contributions that have the potential to drive meaningful change and progress.

These principles work in harmony to uphold the integrity and credibility of the knowledge ecosystem supported by KBC. Through the combined efforts of K-Chain, LightWeb, Oracle AI, and Proof-of-Knowledge, the Y-Engine ensures that only the most valuable and reliable knowledge is accessible to users.
