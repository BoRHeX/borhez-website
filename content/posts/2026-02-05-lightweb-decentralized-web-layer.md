# Illuminating the Decentralized Web: LightWeb and its Role in the KBC Ecosystem

In the realm of Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC), LightWeb stands as a beacon of decentralized information exchange, enabling the seamless sharing of knowledge across the globe. This innovative layer plays a crucial role in facilitating the flow of verifiable knowledge within the KBC ecosystem, ultimately contributing to the creation of a trustworthy and inclusive knowledge economy.

## Overview

- **Key Principles:** LightWeb operates as a decentralized network that enables efficient sharing of information among users within the KBC platform. It serves as a vital component in the transmission of knowledge claims stored on the K-Chain, providing a secure and reliable infrastructure for the exchange of verifiable expertise.
  
- **Relation to K-Chain, Oracle AI, and Proof-of-Knowledge:** LightWeb works in tandem with K-Chain, the distributed ledger that stores immutable knowledge claims, and Oracle AI, the intelligent engine that validates and retrieves knowledge on demand. Together, these components form the backbone of the KBC platform, with LightWeb serving as the decentralized web layer that facilitates the seamless flow of information.
