## Knowledge Blocks (KBs): Claims + Evidence

Imagine a world where knowledge is not just a tool for personal growth but a valuable asset that can be securely stored, shared, and rewarded. This is the vision of Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC), where Knowledge Blocks (KBs) play a crucial role in transforming information into digital currency. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of Knowledge Blocks, focusing on how claims and evidence come together to form the building blocks of a decentralized knowledge economy.

## Overview

- **Key Principles**: Knowledge Blocks (KBs) are essentially verifiable knowledge claims supported by evidence. These claims can range from scientific discoveries to historical facts, and they are stored on the distributed ledger known as K-Chain. The evidence backing these claims is crucial for establishing their credibility and ensuring the integrity of the knowledge economy.

- **Relation to KBC's Foundations**: Knowledge Blocks align closely with KBC's core technologies. K-Chain provides a secure and immutable storage solution for KBs, ensuring that no fraudulent information can be added or altered. LightWeb facilitates the efficient sharing of KBs across the network, enabling users to access a wide range of knowledge easily. Oracle AI serves as the intelligent engine that validates the accuracy of KBs and retrieves relevant information on demand. Finally, Proof-of-Knowledge replaces traditional proofs of work or stake, incentivizing contributors to share their expertise and contribute to the growth of the knowledge economy.
