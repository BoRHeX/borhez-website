With the rise of fake news and biased content, it has become increasingly difficult to discern fact from fiction. However, the Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) project is working to combat these issues through the use of Oracle AI.\nWhat is Oracle AI? Oracle AI is a cutting-edge technology that utilizes artificial intelligence to verify the authenticity and accuracy of information. By leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning, Oracle AI is able to sift through vast amounts of data to identify and eliminate misinformation and bias.\nVerifiable Knowledge At the core of the KBC project is the concept of verifiable knowledge. This means that all information stored on the K-Chain, the decentralized blockchain network that powers KBC, must be verified and validated by Oracle AI before it can be added to the blockchain. This ensures that only accurate and reliable information is stored on the K-Chain, making it a trustworthy source of knowledge.\nProof-of-Knowledge Proof-of-Knowledge is the mechanism by which Oracle AI verifies information on the K-Chain. When a piece of information is submitted to the K-Chain, Oracle AI will analyze it to determine its accuracy and authenticity. If the information passes the verification process, it is added to the blockchain, along with a proof-of-knowledge stamp that serves as a seal of approval.\nK-Chain The K-Chain is the backbone of the KBC project, serving as the decentralized blockchain network where verified knowledge is stored. By utilizing blockchain technology, the K-Chain ensures that information is secure, transparent, and immutable. This means that once information is added to the K-Chain, it cannot be altered or tampered with, providing a reliable source of knowledge for users.\nLightWeb LightWeb is the user interface that allows individuals to access and interact with the information stored on the K-Chain. Through LightWeb, users can search for information, view verified content, and contribute their own knowledge to the blockchain. This user-friendly interface makes it easy for anyone to access accurate and reliable information on a wide range of topics.\nCombating Misinformation and Bias With the rise of fake news and biased content online, it is more important than ever to have a reliable source of information. By leveraging Oracle AI to verify knowledge and eliminate misinformation, the KBC project is paving the way for a more transparent and trustworthy internet. Through the use of advanced technology and a decentralized blockchain network, KBC is able to combat misinformation and bias, providing users with a reliable source of knowledge that they can trust.\nIn conclusion, Oracle AI is a powerful tool in the fight against misinformation and bias. By verifying information on the K-Chain and ensuring that only accurate knowledge is stored on the blockchain, the KBC project is revolutionizing the way we access and interact with information online. With the help of Oracle AI, we can create a more transparent and trustworthy internet for all.\n","wordCount":"487","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-08-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-08-06T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Master BoRHeZ"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://borhez.com/posts/2025-08-06-how-oracle-ai-combats-misinformation-and/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"KBC by Master BoRHeZ","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://borhez.com/images/logo-gold-transparent.png"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><div id=site-alert><p>Website under construction</p></div><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://borhez.com/ accesskey=h title="KBC by Master BoRHeZ (Alt + H)"><img src=https://borhez.com/images/logo-gold-transparent.png alt aria-label=logo height=40>KBC by Master BoRHeZ</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
