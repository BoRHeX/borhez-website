Off-chain computation is a crucial concept in the realm of blockchain technology, and it plays a vital role in the Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) ecosystem. By understanding how off-chain computation works and its significance, we can appreciate how KBC leverages this technology to revolutionize the way we interact with knowledge and information.
Overview


What is Off-Chain Computation?: Off-chain computation refers to the process of performing computations outside the main blockchain network. This allows for faster processing speeds, lower costs, and increased scalability, as not all transactions and computations need to be recorded on the blockchain itself."><meta name=author content="Master BoRHeZ"><link rel=canonical href=https://borhez.com/posts/2025-12-10-off-chain-computation/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.523027fdf36232178299d30abaf52649ca4421d4631a991f5e336299dc744072.css integrity="sha256-UjAn/fNiMheCmdMKuvUmScpEIdRjGpkfXjNimdx0QHI=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://borhez.com/images/logo-gold-transparent.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://borhez.com/images/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://borhez.com/images/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://borhez.com/images/logo-gold-transparent.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://borhez.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://borhez.com/posts/2025-12-10-off-chain-computation/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://borhez.com/posts/2025-12-10-off-chain-computation/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="KBC by Master BoRHeZ"><meta property="og:title" content="Off-Chain Computation — Daily KBC Note (2025-12-10)"><meta property="og:description" content="Off-Chain Computation: Unleashing the Power of Knowledge Off-chain computation is a crucial concept in the realm of blockchain technology, and it plays a vital role in the Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) ecosystem.
