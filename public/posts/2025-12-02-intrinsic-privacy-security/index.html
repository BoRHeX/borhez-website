In a world where data breaches and privacy concerns are becoming all too common, the concept of intrinsic privacy and security is more important than ever. For the Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) project, ensuring the privacy and security of users&rsquo; knowledge claims is not just a priority, but a core value that underpins the entire platform.
Overview
Key Principles:


Privacy: Intrinsic privacy refers to the inherent protection of users&rsquo; data and information within the KBC ecosystem. By design, KBC strives to safeguard the anonymity and confidentiality of knowledge contributors, ensuring that sensitive knowledge claims are kept secure."><meta name=author content="Master BoRHeZ"><link rel=canonical href=https://borhez.com/posts/2025-12-02-intrinsic-privacy-security/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.523027fdf36232178299d30abaf52649ca4421d4631a991f5e336299dc744072.css integrity="sha256-UjAn/fNiMheCmdMKuvUmScpEIdRjGpkfXjNimdx0QHI=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://borhez.com/images/logo-gold-transparent.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://borhez.com/images/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://borhez.com/images/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://borhez.com/images/logo-gold-transparent.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://borhez.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://borhez.com/posts/2025-12-02-intrinsic-privacy-security/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://borhez.com/posts/2025-12-02-intrinsic-privacy-security/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="KBC by Master BoRHeZ"><meta property="og:title" content="Intrinsic Privacy & Security — Daily KBC Note (2025-12-02)"><meta property="og:description" content="Intrinsic Privacy & Security In a world where data breaches and privacy concerns are becoming all too common, the concept of intrinsic privacy and security is more important than ever.
