&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s digital world, trust and immutability are crucial factors when it comes to any kind of transaction or exchange of information. With the rise of blockchain technology, we have seen how decentralized systems can provide a level of security and transparency that was previously unimaginable. The Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) project takes this concept to the next level with its innovative approach to verifiable knowledge and Proof-of-Knowledge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The vision of lightweb as a decentralized knowledge internet</title><link>https://borhez.com/posts/2025-08-02-the-vision-of-lightweb-as-a-decentralize/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://borhez.com/posts/2025-08-02-the-vision-of-lightweb-as-a-decentralize/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Vision of LightWeb: A Decentralized Knowledge Internet&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the ever-evolving landscape of the digital age, the concept of a decentralized knowledge internet is becoming increasingly relevant. The Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) project is at the forefront of this movement, with its innovative vision of LightWeb. This vision represents a paradigm shift in how we access and verify information online, offering a decentralized platform that empowers users to engage with knowledge in a new, secure, and transparent way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How the k-chain ensures trust and immutability</title><link>https://borhez.com/posts/2025-07-31-how-the-k-chain-ensures-trust-and-immutability/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://borhez.com/posts/2025-07-31-how-the-k-chain-ensures-trust-and-immutability/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="building-trust-in-knowledge-based-currency-the-role-of-k-chain">Building Trust in Knowledge-Based Currency: The Role of K-Chain&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In an era where information is abundant yet often unreliable, the Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) project emerges as a beacon of trust and innovation. At its core, KBC is designed to revolutionize how we perceive and utilize knowledge in digital transactions. A pivotal component of this groundbreaking system is the K-Chain, a technology that ensures trust and immutability. Let’s delve into how K-Chain, along with other components like Proof-of-Knowledge, LightWeb, and Oracle AI, transforms the landscape of digital currency.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What is KBC?</title><link>https://borhez.com/posts/what-is-kbc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://borhez.com/posts/what-is-kbc/</guid><description>&lt;p>KBC stands for &lt;strong>Knowledge‑Based Currency&lt;/strong>, a novel form of money backed not by gold or government fiat but by verified knowledge. When you contribute a fact, a discovery or a solution to the KnowledgeChain, Oracle AIs validate it through a Proof of Knowledge process. If accepted, your contribution is recorded as a new block and you earn KBC tokens proportionate to its significance.&lt;/p>
