In the digital age, the importance of archiving and preservation cannot be overstated. Just like ancient civilizations meticulously recorded their knowledge on durable materials to pass down to future generations, KBC recognizes the value of safeguarding knowledge for the long term. Archiving and preservation ensure that valuable information remains accessible and intact, serving as the foundation of a thriving knowledge economy.
Overview: Key Principles and KBC&rsquo;s Foundations

Archiving: Archiving involves the systematic storage and maintenance of information for future reference. It ensures that knowledge remains available even as technologies evolve.
Preservation: Preservation focuses on protecting information from degradation or loss. It involves strategies to maintain the integrity and usability of knowledge over time.
