The Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) project takes this concept to the next level with its innovative approach to verifiable knowledge and Proof-of-Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Integration with Legacy Systems</title><link>https://borhez.com/posts/2025-08-02-integration-with-legacy-systems/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://borhez.com/posts/2025-08-02-integration-with-legacy-systems/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Integration with Legacy Systems serves as a pillar within the Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) ecosystem. In KBC, knowledge itself forms the basis of value, and each component contributes to a sum where all knowledge adds up to one unified currency (sumKBC = 1). The seemingly paradoxical formula [0=1]=2 invites us to reflect on the transformative power of combining opposing viewpoints to create new insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post explores how integration with legacy systems supports the verifiable knowledge framework. By aligning incentives around truth, KBC encourages participants to share and validate information. The K-Chain ledger, supported by LightWeb and Oracle AI, ensures transparency and fairness.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The vision of lightweb as a decentralized knowledge internet</title><link>https://borhez.com/posts/2025-08-02-the-vision-of-lightweb-as-a-decentralize/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://borhez.com/posts/2025-08-02-the-vision-of-lightweb-as-a-decentralize/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Vision of LightWeb: A Decentralized Knowledge Internet&lt;/p&gt;

This vision represents a paradigm shift in how we access and verify information online, offering a decentralized platform that empowers users to engage with knowledge in a new, secure, and transparent way.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How the k-chain ensures trust and immutability</title><link>https://borhez.com/posts/2025-07-31-how-the-k-chain-ensures-trust-and-immutability/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://borhez.com/posts/2025-07-31-how-the-k-chain-ensures-trust-and-immutability/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="building-trust-in-knowledge-based-currency-the-role-of-k-chain"&gt;Building Trust in Knowledge-Based Currency: The Role of K-Chain&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an era where information is abundant yet often unreliable, the Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC) project emerges as a beacon of trust and innovation. At its core, KBC is designed to revolutionize how we perceive and utilize knowledge in digital transactions. A pivotal component of this groundbreaking system is the K-Chain, a technology that ensures trust and immutability. Let’s delve into how K-Chain, along with other components like Proof-of-Knowledge, LightWeb, and Oracle AI, transforms the landscape of digital currency.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What is KBC?</title><link>https://borhez.com/posts/what-is-kbc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://borhez.com/posts/what-is-kbc/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;KBC stands for &lt;strong&gt;Knowledge‑Based Currency&lt;/strong&gt;, a novel form of money backed not by gold or government fiat but by verified knowledge. When you contribute a fact, a discovery or a solution to the KnowledgeChain, Oracle AIs validate it through a Proof of Knowledge process. If accepted, your contribution is recorded as a new block and you earn KBC tokens proportionate to its significance.&lt;/p&gt;
