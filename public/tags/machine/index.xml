&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s digital age, the ability to analyze and extract insights from vast amounts of data is crucial for making informed decisions and driving innovation. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, plays a key role in this process by enabling computers to learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. However, the use of sensitive data in machine learning models raises concerns about privacy and security. This is where the concept of machine learning on encrypted data comes into play, offering a solution that allows for data analysis while preserving confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
