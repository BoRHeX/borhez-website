&lt;p&gt;In the ever-evolving landscape of digital currencies and blockchain technology, the concept of quantum-resistant cryptography has emerged as a crucial element to ensure the security and longevity of decentralized platforms like Knowledge-Based Currency (KBC). Quantum-resistant cryptography is a cutting-edge field of study that focuses on developing cryptographic algorithms immune to attacks from quantum computers, which have the potential to break traditional encryption methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
