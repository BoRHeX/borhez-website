&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s interconnected world, the rise of edge computing has become a game-changer for decentralized networks like KBC. Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data closer to where it is generated, rather than relying on a centralized data center. This approach is crucial for decentralized networks like KBC, as it allows for faster processing, reduced latency, and increased privacy and security.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
